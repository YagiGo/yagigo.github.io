    "introduction": "Hi there! I am a web developer currently living in Tokyo, Japan. I am interested in creating mobile-first, responsive SPAs with modern frontend framework such as React/nextJS, Tailwind CSS, webpack etc. Along with start-small, easy-to-scale backend integration. Becoming a qualified full-stack developer is kind of my goal and am working on it ;) You can check my GitHub account and person blog by clicking the icons down below"
