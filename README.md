# A complete refactoring of the jQuery-Bootstrap centered resume page
This is a resume page originally composed with good-old jQuery, vanilla JavaScript and bootstrap almost three years ago.
We all know how that went down, so... I rewrote this thing with React, just like everyone likes nowadays.

## Things I have used back then
Gulp, vanilla JS and css, bootstrap, jQuery

## Things planning on using
React(probably with a healthy dose of nextJS? We'll see) and all the good stuff that come with it (less, yarn and webpack just to name a few)

## How to run this
you know the drills

`yarn`

`yarn start`

`yarn test`

`yarn build`

`yarn eject`

`yarn lint` 

planning on using eslint with prettier for code styling check
